# Wheel of Fate!

## Background
All engineers in Company X take it in turns to support the business for half a day at a time. Currently,
generating a schedule that shows whoâ€™s turn is it to support the business is being done manually
and we need to automate that!

### Assumptions
You can assume that Company X has 10 engineers.
You can assume that the schedule will span two weeks and start on the first working day of the
upcoming week.

### Rules
An engineer can do at most one half day shift in a day.
An engineer cannot have half day shifts on consecutive days.
Each engineer should have completed one whole day of support in any 2 week period.

### Important
These rules are liable to change in the future, so make sure your design is flexible enough to be able
to add new rules.
